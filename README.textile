h1. has_breadcrumbs

has_breadcrumbs is a simple plugin that adds a `breadcrumb` object into
controllers and views.

h2. Instalation

1) Install the plugin with `script/plugin install git://github.com/danielvlopes/has_breadcrumbs.git`

h2. Usage

On your controller:
<pre>
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
	before_filter :add_initial_breadcrumbs

	private
		def add_initial_breadcrumbs
			breadcrumb.add 'Home', root_path
		end
end

class ThingsController < ApplicationController
	def index
		breadcrumb.add 'Things', things_path
	end
end
</pre>

You don't need to provide an URL; in that case, a span will be generated
instead of a link:

<pre>
breadcrumb.add 'Some page'
</pre>

You can set additional HTML attributes if you need to:

<pre>
breadcrumb.add 'Home', root_path, :id => 'home', :title => 'Go to the home page'
</pre>

On your view (possibly application.html.erb):

<pre>You are here: <%= breadcrumb.display %></pre>

You can set your own separator:

<pre>
You are here: <%= breadcrumb.display %>
</pre>

The output in your html will be something like below:

<pre>
	<ul id="breadcrumbs">
		<li class="item-0"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
		<li class="item-1"><a href="#">Main section</a></li>
		<li class="item-2"><a href="#">Sub section</a></li>
		<li class="item-3 last">The page you are on right now</li>
	</ul>
</pre>

For a good css example take a look in examples folder.
